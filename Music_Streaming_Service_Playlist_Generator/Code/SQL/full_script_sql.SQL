-- Note that the dataset “Words” and “user” were initially downloaded from Kaggle.com 
--   under the EMI contest. We then added Sex and Age to the Words database via Excel 
--   vlookup function. This was done to query datasets by gender and by age, which are 
--   discussed in detail in the project documentation.
